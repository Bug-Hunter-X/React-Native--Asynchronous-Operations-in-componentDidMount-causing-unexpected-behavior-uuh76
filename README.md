# React Native Async Operation Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving asynchronous operations within the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.  The bug arises from updating the component's state after the component has unmounted, leading to warnings and potential crashes. The solution illustrates proper handling of asynchronous tasks to prevent this issue.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  It fetches data from an API within `componentDidMount` without considering the possibility of the component unmounting before the data arrives. This can result in stale closures and updates to unmounted components.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct approach.  It uses a flag to track whether the component is mounted and ensures state updates only occur if the component is still active, preventing errors and improving stability.
